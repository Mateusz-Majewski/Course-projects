# Course projects
 Hello!
 
 Welcome to my GitHub Course-projects repository. Here you may find my approach to solving Java online course exercises.
 
 The exercises and simpler lessons are taken from the online course on Udemy https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/
 
 My plan is to complete them all and then one by one update them to newer versions by expanding their functionality and making the code cleaner.
